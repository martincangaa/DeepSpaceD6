DEEP SPACE D6

The crew will have numbers assigned to each role and will be treated as constants

CREW_COMMANDER = 0
CREW_TACTICAL = 1
CREW_MEDICAL = 2
CREW_SCIENCE = 3
CREW_ENGINEERING = 4
CREW_SCANNER = 5

crew = [CREW_COMMANDER, CREW_COMANDER, CREW_MEDICAL, CREW_SCIENCE, CREW_ENGINEERING, CREW_SCANNER]

THREAD STRUCTURE

The enemy data is contained in an array of dictionaries each dictionary acts as an specific thread:

thread = [{'name': 'Albizu', 'description': 'Just Albizu, tbh he be bussin', 'dice_numbers': [2,7], 'health': 4, 'attack': '8IS', 'volatility': True, 'assignable_crew': [CREW_COMANDER, CREW_COMMANDER], 'assigned_crew': [],
    'block_till_complete': [], 'send_infirmary': True, 'mercenary': True, 'existentialism': [True, CREW_COMANDER], 'return_scaner': True},'stunt': False, 'tactical_to_infirmary': False]

KEY EXPLANATION:

    name = name of the thread (ex. 'Albizu')

    description = description of the thread (ex. 'Just Albizu, tbh he got tha drip')

    dice_numbers = numbers that will determine when the thread will roll (ex. [2,7])

    health = health of the thread (ex. 4)

    attack = string with the damage of the thread to the ship (ex. '8IS') 

        types of damage:

            NM = normal mode

            IS = ignore shields

            DS = destroy all shields

    volatility = if the thread, when activated, only lasts one turn and then is discarded, volatility is True

    assignable_crew = crew members that can be assigned to the thread in order to disable it (ex. [CREW_COMANDER, CREW_COMMANDER])

    assigned_crew = crew members that are assigned to the thread (ex. [])

    blocked_till_complete = crew members that are blocked by the thread until the thread is destroyed (ex. [CREW_MEDICAL, CREW_SCIENCE])

    send_infirmary = if the thread is activated it will send a random crew member to the infirmary (ex. True)

    'mercenary' = special card in the game

    existentialism = this thread must be completed before assigning any other (ex. CREW_COMANDER) if you try to assign it to something else it will be blocked (ex. [True, CREW_COMANDER])

        [True, CREW_COMANDER] --> The True means that the thread is existential and CREW_COMANDER is the crew member 
        that will be blocked if the assignable_crew does not match with the crew_assigned
